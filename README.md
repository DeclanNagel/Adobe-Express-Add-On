## About

This project was submitted to the **Adobe Express Add-On Hackathon 2025**.  
The add-on allows users to upload an image and check whether it was generated by AI.  
The user interface (UI) displays a likelihood percentage of the image being AI-generated.

The detection process works in two stages:
1. **Metadata Analysis:** The system checks if the image contains metadata typically inserted by AI generation tools.
2. **Visual Pattern Recognition:** If no metadata is found, the system uses a Hugging Face API to analyze the image for visual patterns commonly associated with AI-generated art.

## Tools Used

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Hugging Face API

## Setup
